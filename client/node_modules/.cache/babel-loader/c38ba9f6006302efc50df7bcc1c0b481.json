When I first read Little Garden I really hated him, but respected how he managed to use his limited resources and a simple plan to take down Dorry and Broggy and trap Zoro, Vivi and Nami. Hell, even Zoro couldn't cut through his wax. That's an impressive fruit if nothing else. When he was fed to a Bananadile in Alabasta I was pretty pleased at first. Felt he deserved such an awful death for the sick way he killed his targets. But he survived Crocodile's assassination attempt, and I respected his tenacity and quick wit. That he was one of the few Baroque Works members to avoid capture only added to me begrudging respect. When we hit Impel Down and we met Mr. 3 again I wasn't expecting much. I missed the Strawhats already, and former antagonists seemed a bit cliche for a team up... But he ended up being incredibly entertaining with Buggy, Luffy and Bon, and I began warming up to him. The argument over who caused the floor to break and him joining in only to realise it absolutely wasn't his wax that did it got one of the first genuine chuckles out of me whilst reading, and made me realise that this guy wasn't so bad. He seemed to be more willing to work with Luffy than Buggy, and his friendship with Buggy was surprisingly genuine. Later when he blocked Magellan's poison with his candle wall, I was stunned. This was an incredibly gutsy move for someone as weak willed as Mr. 3...and not only that he was the only one who managed to stall him? A reminder that Devil Fruit abilities actually mattered in this manga, and it wasn't all about who had the biggest powerlevel. At this point he quickly became one of my absolute favourite non Strawhats. Then when he hit Marineford, I figured that was the end for him. The war raged and in all the chaos I lost track of where he was in the story. Which seems to have been the point. Mr. 3 became the damn MVP in the 'rescue Ace' mission when he risked getting killed by sneaking onto the platform quite literally under Sengoku's nose and disguising himself as a guard. And that he does it to honour Mr. 2's sacrfice? A man he formerly hated? Well, at that point Mr. 3 had rocketed past all non Strawhats. He doesn't do a lot, but by god what he does do sure has an impact. He frees all the Impel Down prisoners with his wax keys, he freed Ace, he helped the gang all escape, and no doubt he's a big part of Buggy's companies success. And now he's a Yonko Commander which is absolutely wild to me. Basically Mr. 3's my absolute favourite character because he is the only character in the entire manga I've had such a radical opinion change on, and all without it feeling sudden and unnatural.\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 13,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 12,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 7,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 6,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 5,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n}\n\n_c = Showposts;\nexport default Showposts;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Showposts\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","Showposts"],"sources":["D:/CSE470/CP/client/src/Showposts.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction Showposts() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <div className=\"px-6 bg-rd text-rt\">\r\n        <div className=\"border border-rb bg-rd-lowbright p-2\">\r\n          <h5 className=\"text-rt-darker text-sm\">\r\n            Posted by u/name 5 hours ago\r\n          </h5>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-2xl mb-3\">Favotite Charecters</h2>\r\n          <div className=\"\">\r\n            <p>\r\n              My favourite character is Mr. 3.
